- Pre-requirements:
====================

You basically need a UNIX(-like) operating system with 
GNU GCC compiler.

If your host architecture is x86_64 (64-bit),  you might
need to install gcc-multilib package which provides
a 32-bit version of libgcc.

If your host architecture is i686 (32-bit), your native
GCC compiler is enough.

Other than that, you need to make sure these packages
are installed:
 
 - autotools : GNU build system to process build scripts.
 - make      : utility to process the Makefiles generated by autotools.
 - binutils  : provides the linker and the assembler.
 - cdrkit    : provides mkisofs, to create an iso image.
 - util-linux: provides fdisk, to create a disk image.

- Compiling Quafios:
=====================

1. The configuration script shall configure Quafios and create Makefiles.
   The script can be found in the top directory that contains
   Quafios source code files. Execute this command from your shell:

   $ ./configure

2. Run "make" to compile Quafios source code.

   $ make

   Now Quafios is compiled and we are ready to install/emulate it.

- Installation on a live CD-ROM:
=================================

1. Create a live CD-ROM image (after you have compiled Quafios):

   $ make isolive

2. Burn the generated "quafios-2.0.1.iso" file in the build
   directory on a blank CD-ROM. To run Quafios from the CD-ROM,
   insert the CD-ROM in your PC and boot from the disc.

   Please note that you can use Quafios multiboot module if you want
   to boot from the ISO image using grub. Just add an entry in grub.cfg
   with these three lines:

    set root='hd#,msdos#' (replace hashes with proper numbers)
    multiboot <build-dir>/boot/multiboot.bin (replace <build-dir>)
    module <build-dir>/quafios-2.0.1.iso (replace <build-dir>)

- Installation on a fixed disk (or usb stick):
===============================================

1. The disk should have MBR partition table and a free primary partition
   for Quafios. There exists a lot of free software that is dedicated for
   disk partitioning, like util-linux package (which contains fdisk command)
   and gparted utility.

2. Once you are ready, type this command in your shell prompt (after
   you have compiled Quafios):

   $ sudo make setup

   Then follow the instructions of the interactive installation script.

- Emulation:
=============

1. Create the live CD-ROM image (after you have compiled Quafios):

   $ make isolive

2. Now you can use the generated "quafios-2.0.1.iso" file as a CD-ROM
   image for your preferred hypervisor/emulator. Quafios should run well
   on Xen, QEMU, and VirtualBox.

- Cleaning up build files:
===========================

 - To clean build files, run "make clean".
 - To clean build files and all files generated by automake and configuration
   script, run "make distclean".
